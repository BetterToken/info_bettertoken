## What is a 3Node

A 3Node is in its essence a server that is installed with Zero-OS.
The formfactor, size, and hardware specs can very from very large (datacenter nodes) to very small (no bigger than a modern modem).
The hardware specifications of a 3Node are one of the factors that determine the amount of ThreeFold the device will farm.

## Plug & Farm
All small nodes that BetterToken ships to its customers are what we call 'plug & farm'. 
This means the node has already been installed and configured to farm for the customer.
There are just 2 very simple steps the customer needs to take.

1. Plug the node into power outlet
2. Provide the node with internet access

The node will be recognized by the ThreeFold Grid and get listed as available capacity.
As long as the 3Node stays online it will farm tokens.

## Cultivation
Besides farming there is also cultivation.
Cultivation is no more than people reserving the capacity on a 3Node.
When user decides to use a farmer's capacity, the farmer in return will receive tokens.
