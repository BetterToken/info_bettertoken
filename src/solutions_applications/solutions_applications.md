    <td>price in TFT for the Pack</td>
    <td>price per Hour in TFT</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>std</td>
    <td>15</td>
    <td>12,000</td>
    <td>800 TFT</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

The larger the pack the more benefit.

Minimum time interval = 15 min (for each started issue)

### Service matrix (Type)

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Code</td>
    <td>Description</td>
    <td>weight</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>Installation support / support / helpdesk</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>B</td>
    <td>Backup management / Monitoring Setup</td>
    <td>1.5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>C</td>
    <td>Development work for 3bot (marketplace, wizards, builders)</td>
    <td>1.5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>D</td>
    <td>UI work, customization 3bot</td>
    <td>1.5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>E</td>
    <td>3e level support (deep level networking, troubleshooting, ...)</td>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>Training Senior / Technical Documentation</td>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>G</td>
    <td>Training Std</td>
    <td>1.5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>H</td>
    <td>Consultancy (tax, blockchain, ...)</td>

  </tr>
</table>


Weight means if 1 h of e.g. UI work is done then the service pack hours used gets multiplied by 1.5.

### Process

Each customer gets a private repo on our gitea (private github) instance where all issues are logged & documentation kept. Engineers will only execute on approved tickets (issue) in the repo and time tracking is done per issue.

All required documentation is in the git repo. Monitoring can be setup if that is what customer wants. Engineers will never go out of service pack nr of included hours, customer will have to buy a new service pack if all hours are used.

### Urgency matrix (Urgency)

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Code</td>
    <td>Description</td>
    <td>weight</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>X</td>
    <td>Office Hours (9-18h for weekday depending location)</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Y</td>
    <td>Out of office hours or weekend day or urgent response required (<4h)</td>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Z</td>
    <td>Super Urgent response required (<60min) or out of office weekend</td>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
</table>


If not Code X, then this will be informed to customer and approval is required before engineer can continue.

For weekend escalation procedure needs to be agreed upon.

If super urgent will try to start working on it < 15 min if not faster.

### Examples

* Normal support in week = 15min from gold pack = 100 TFT

* Weekend night, 3e level support = 1h from platinum = 250 * 2 * 3 = 1500 TFT

**The TFT used to buy a Service Pack are to be/have been bought through BetterToken.*
