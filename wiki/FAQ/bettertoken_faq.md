## SoHo Nodes

### What Does Plug & Farm Mean?

### How Many ThreeFold Tokens Will SoHo Nodes Farm For Me?
In the [SoHo Node section](soho_nodes.md) we have added 3 simulations for each node.
Important to note is that these are simulations of scenarios that could happen but should not be looked at as a guarantee in any shape or form.

### What is the warrantee period for a SoHo Node?
The carry-in warrantee for a SoHo Node is 2 years.
In the event of a node having a defect it is the Farmer's responsibility to ship the node back to BetterToken.
BetterToken will only cover the costs for shipping the node back to the farmer (if within the EU).

### Do I have to pay shipping costs when I order a SoHo Node at BetterToken?
Europe is home to BetterToken.
Therefore BetterToken can ship within the EU with no shipping costs and free of import taxes however, BetterToken is more than willing to ship outside of the EU but all shipping, import taxes, and other costs related are to be covered by the customer.

### What is the minimum connection I need to put a SoHo Node in my home?
BetterToken recommends at least a 300 Mbps down/20 Mbps up connection for the SoHo Nodes. Any modern day connection should be able to reach these speeds but to be sure you can always check connection speed testers like: [Speedtest.net](https://www.speedtest.net/) or [Fast](https://fast.com/)
