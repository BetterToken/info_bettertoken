# Acquire tokens To Setup Your 3Bot

As purchasers of a 3Node at BetterToken we will send you an initial (small) amount of TFT to help you set up your 3Bot.
You can reach out via: [tokensfor3bot@bettertoken.com](mailto:tokensfor3bot@bettertoken.com)

Please include in this email:

- Your Name
- Farm name
- ThreeFold Wallet Address

Keep in mind: The tokens we send you will be a very limited amount to get your Hosted 3Bot up and running for a while. You will have to back up your 3Bot name and recovery password if you wish to ever change something about your farm again. This to start it up again once or if you decide to do so.
