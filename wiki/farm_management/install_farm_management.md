# Install the Farm Management Application

Install the farm management application. To do so, click the ```Farm Management``` tab on the left side menu.
Then click the ```Install now``` button

Once the package is installed, the page will reload and the ```farm management``` UI will appear.

This is where your farm will show up once we have assigned the farm to your 3Bot ID.
Once your farm shows up in your 3Bot dashboard you can now control the different parameters about the Farm.

More info on farm management can be found in the [Farm Management Section In ThreeFold Manual Wiki](https://manual.threefold.io/#/farm_management)
