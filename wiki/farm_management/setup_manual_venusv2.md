# 3Node Setup Guide

**Congratulations on becoming a Threefold Farmer!**
In order to add your 3Node to the Threefold Grid a few steps
need to be taken. Once completed you will be able to see the status of your 3Node. If you have any additional questions or issues, feel free to contact us through [support@bettertoken.com](mailto:support@bettertoken.com)

## Step 1: Verify package contents
Inspect the package and its contents directly after delivery and report any shipping damages to support@bettertoken.com immediately.

Verify package contents:

- 1x Venus V2 Node
- 1x Power adapter
- 1x USB Drive (already plugged into the 3Node)

## Step 2: Connecting the 3Node to a power source and modem

1. Connect the power cable to the power adapter.
2. Connect the power adapter to the “DC-12V” connector at the back of the 3Node.
3. Connect one end of the provided Ethernet cable to the “LAN” connector at the back of the 3Node and the other end to an available Ethernet port on your home router. *
4. Connect the power cable to a power outlet.
5. Press the power on button, light should provide visual confirmation that the 3Node is now running. 

**IMPORTANT: Home router ports that can be used for this purpose are typically labelled “Port 1-4”. If you are unsure which port to use, please refer to the User Documentation of the router and check which port should be used.**

PLEASE NOTE: A 3Node should always be placed on a dust-free and flat service located close to your home modem (not provided by Threefold). The 3Node is designed to be exposed to in-house conditions and should never be placed in direct sunlight, extreme temperatures (hot/cold) or humid areas.

## Step 3: Adding your farm to your 3Bot (optional)

**If you are fine with your Farm being linked to the BetterToken 3Bot you can skip this step.**

1. Head over to our [Farm Setup & Management](farm_management_intro.md) section and complete the steps to add your farm to a 3Bot.
2. Head over to our [ThreeFold Explorer](https://explorer.threefold.io/) to see if your 3Node is up and running by searching your farm name.

## Troubleshooting

### The 3Node does not start after pressing the power button?

Please verify the following connections:

1. Between the power adapter and the power cable.
2. Between the power adapter and the “DC-12V” connector.
3. Between the power cable and the outlet.
4. Verify that mains power is available on the wall outlet.

### The 3Node is not showing up on the explorer
1. Make sure your search query is correctly spelled when searching your farm name (please toggle "show offline nodes" when doing so).
2. Make sure your network connection is healthy and up and there are no outages in your area.
