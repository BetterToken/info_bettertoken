# Node Hosting

BetterToken has access to a medium sized datacenter in Lochristi, Belgium.
In this datacenter we host several nodes for customers.

The datacenter in Lochristi has all the measurements to guarantee the most uptime and the best connectivity.

- An Uninterruptible Power Supply is ready take over whenever the powernet would fail to deliver.
- Ready to rack any standard 40 Inch node (we support most common depths)
