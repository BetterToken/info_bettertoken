# SoHo Nodes
In collaboration with Mazraa.io we have come up with 3 so called SoHo Nodes.
SoHo stands for Small Office Home Office as these nodes can be put almost everywhere.
The Pluto Node is the smallest one in the family and is no bigger than a modern internet modem.

# European Union
Europe is home to BetterToken. This makes it so that we can service any country within the EU easily.
Therefore BetterToken can ship within the EU with no shipping costs and free of import taxes. BetterToken is more than willing to ship outside of the EU but all shipping, import taxes, and other costs related are to be covered by the customer.

# Batches
BetterToken delivers all nodes in batches of 50 for multiple reasons:
- Easier to process
- We need to plan the slot for the assembly line to be free to assemble, install, configure and test.
- Cut costs to the max so we can supply at lower fees.

# Pre-register
To order a node you can contact us directly or go to the [farmer.threefold.io](https://farmer.threefold.io) page. This page is an initiave of the ThreeFold Foundation to gather interest for the upcoming batches. All nodes ordered within EU borders automatically will be passed on by ThreeFold Foundation to us for processing.
